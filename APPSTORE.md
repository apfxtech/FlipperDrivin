Time attack, pass the most cars in 99 seconds

Technical info so far:
- Game runs at a constant rate of 67 frames per second
- Rendered in 3 colors: black, gray, white
- Grayscale is achieved by flickering quickly between black and white, and also alternating the dithering pattern, so it looks more stable. The resulting grayscale is almost perfectly stable, except for a sort of visible subtle scanline glitch
